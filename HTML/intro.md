# Intro
HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the base standard for developing websites. HTML descripes the structure and content of a website, while CSS is colors, styles, fonts, etc. JavaScript is the real interactivity part of a website, and allows developers to do more, like having the site check for updates, or saving cookies, or having buttons that edit the structure of a webpage.
## Software To Develop With
To create a website, all you technically need is TextEdit / Notepad or some other text editor, but I highly recommend using [repl.it](https://repl.it) to make your websites. You can publically host them at your own sub-domain, use tools like auto-complete, auto-correct, and text colors. There are also programs like VisualStudio that have these features, but make it a bit more difficult to actually host these websites. It's honestly your choice, though.
## Tutorial Setup
A basic tutorial will have code snippets that you can look at and copy to try out yourself. Here is an example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>A New Webpage</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>I'm an HTML document.</p>
</body>

</html>
```
It is highly recommended to follow along in your editor. Learning website development is just as much **doing** as it is **learning**.
